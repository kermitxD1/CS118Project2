Design:
-First I start the program with creating a socket and having it connect. 
-Then a file is opened
-Then the data is sent over to the server, 
-from there the socket is closed
-Once the server reeives the data 
-it creates a new file and it writes the data into the file 
-Then program stops.

Challenges:
This was a very challenging project due to me never using ubuntu before as well as never done a VM before. Being able to create socket programming was challenging due to understanding how to make that connection happen between the server and client. c. Also having to use a different program to run my VM because i have a macbook was difficutlt as well. I coudlnt use virtual box I had to use parallel.
